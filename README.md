# Simplified-Train-Ticket-Booking-System
Implemention of a  simplified Client/Server train ticket booking system.

Instructions for the software and comments in the program are mainly in Chinese.


Notice:

Before running the Train_Server, you need to have access to the corresponding database "Access". Then you need to put the Database1.accdb in a proper place and change the corresponding address in Train_server(Form2.cs, Form3.cs and Form6.cs). 

Before running the The_Trainbooking_Server, you need to have the Train_Server running correctly and connected to Internet. Then you need to change the target IP "TIP" in Server.cs in The_Trainbooking_Server to the IP of the Train_Server, which must be a constant value.

As for the password, you may check the Database1.accdb to find the username and the password for each account. You may also need to check Form1.cs in Train_Server to find the password for the server.

Actually, this version is not well developed as it's done in a few days, which leads to only a few functions and even some potential problems. This program is releaseed to commemorate that period and provide novices like me a rough example of how to do program like this.


Finished in 2017.
